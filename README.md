Hello World!

Joe Choi, here.  I just finished my Ph.D. in Optics at The Institute of Optics, University of Rochester in 2016.  I'm very interested in combining data science with quantum computing in a business environment.  This is because I'm passionate about all 3 of these fields and feel I can be world-class in all 3 combined.
